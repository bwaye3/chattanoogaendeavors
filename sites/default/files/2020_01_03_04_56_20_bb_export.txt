By simple acts of human kindness through letter writing and visitation, members reignite hope in the hearts of those living in the shadow of the criminal justice system:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Reminding them that they haven&rsquo;t been forgotten</li>\r\n<li>Supporting them to make the most of their time in prison</li>\r\n<li>Assisting their loved ones who may be suffering in silence, and</li>\r\n<li>Helping them to create a network of support for when they come home</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Although Stephen&rsquo;s Table committees may be formed in religious, academic, or community organizations, Stephen&rsquo;s Table is not allied with any denomination, ideology, or social agenda; does not wish to engage in any controversy; neither endorses nor opposes any cause beyond its own.
